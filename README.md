JS Engine
- JS is single threaded language which uses callback queue.
- Computer can only understand ones and zeros. Computer does not know what is JS file so V8 engine understands JS, it reads our code and then it runs this code.
- Thanks to the JS Engine which was found by Brendan Eich(SpiderMonkey for Firefox), we are able to run the code on a browser, previously could only read HTML and CSS.
