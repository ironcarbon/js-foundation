# JS Engine
* JS is single threaded language which uses callback queue.
*  Computer can only understand ones and zeros. Computer does not know what is JS file so V8 engine understands JS, it reads our code and then it runs this code.
*  Thanks to the JS Engine which was found by Brendan Eich(SpiderMonkey for Firefox), we are able to run the code on a browser, previously could only read HTML and CSS.

* JS File        ->         JS Engine        ->          Computer

*  JS Engine understand the JS file and tell the computer what to do(translator)

# Inside the JS Engine:

* JS engine can be built by anybody but it is a lot of work. V8 engine which was built by Google is the fastest and is written in C++ which is low level programming language.
* If everybody creates its own JS, it would be a total chaos which is why ECMAScript was created. It defines the standard of JS engines and how it should work. ECMAScript is a governing body of a JS that essentially decides how the language should be standardized.
* Once we understand JS engine principles and why itâ€™s built the way, we will able to write OPTIMIZED CODE.

# Interpreters and Compilers

* There are 2 ways to run JS using an interpreter or a compiler.

* In programming, there are generally 2 ways of translating to machine language or something that our computers can understand. It applies to most programming languages like JS, Python, Java, C++. They all use some of these concepts.

Interpreter: Translation happens LINE BY LINE on the fly.

Compiler: DOES NOT TRANSLATE ON THE FLY.  Compilers work a head of time to create a translation of what code we have written and compiles down to usually a language that can be understood by machines.
* It basically takes the WHOLE CODE and try to understand what code does. Then, it takes the program in JS or ay type of language and WRITE A NEW PROGRAM IN A NEW LANGUAGE that computer can understand.
