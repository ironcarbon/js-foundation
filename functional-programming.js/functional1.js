// Functional Programming
// Packaging the into separate chunks so that everything's well organized in each part of the code.
// The idea of functional programming is separation between data over a program and the behaviour of a program.
//In all objects created in functional programming are immutable! It means once something is created, it can not be changed.
// Avoid shared state! Main principle is PURE FUNCTIONS
 // Functional programming has so many restraints so it does not let the code get out of hand.
